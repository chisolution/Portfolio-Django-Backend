## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| External DB provider downtime | Low | High | Use managed service with SLA; implement retry logic |
| Render service restart during request | Medium | Medium | Stateless design; connection pooling; health checks |
| Data loss on deployment | Low | Critical | External database; migration scripts; backups |
| Performance degradation on free tier | Medium | Medium | Caching; query optimization; load testing |
| CORS issues with frontend | Medium | Medium | Early integration testing; clear documentation |
